# Big-Integer-ADT
This is a design for an integer data structure that can recreate numbers from base 1 to 1000000000. It can also hold more data than the base integer data structure provided by C++.

## Building

Build the program Arithmetic with:
...
$ make Arithmetic
...

## Running

Run the program Lex with:
...
$ ./Arithmetic <input file> <output file>
...

Build the program BigIntegerClient with:
...
$ make BigIntegerClient
...

## Running

Run the program BigIntegerClient with:
...
$ ./BigIntegerClient
...

Build the program ListClient with:
...
$ make ListClient
...

## Running

Run the program ListClient with:
...
$ ./ListClient
...

## Arithmetic.cpp

This is the main file of the program. Utilizes List.cpp and BigInteger.cpp

## BigInteger.cpp

This is the file that contains the functions for the ADT BigInteger, which is utilized for Arithmetic.cpp operations.

## BigInteger.h

This is the header file for BigInteger.cpp

## List.cpp

This is the file that contains the functions for the ADT List, which is utilized for Arithmetic.cpp operations.

## List.h

This is the header file for List.cpp

## BigIntegerTest.cpp

This is the test file for BigInteger.cpp

## ListTest.cpp

This is the test file for List.cpp
